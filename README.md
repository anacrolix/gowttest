# gowttest

This is a super bare bones port of Webtorrent. It's not meant to become a client, just an example to kick off a Go Webtorrent implementation. Feel free to ask questions, create PRs (let me know via issue/WIP PR) or take the code and run with it. I currently expect to archive/remove the repo when a decent implementation becomes available.
